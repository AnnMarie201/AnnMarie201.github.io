My journey to Data Science comes from my experience in the investment management industry.  When I first started in this industry, portfolio managers would send drivers to the airports to pick up the earliest copy of the Financial Times (Yes, I am that old). Now, we are inundated with news, information and data. As I watched the industry change, it motivated me to learn data science.

In reality, data is everywhere. Over the past few decades, our daily actions, thoughts and plans are being lived and recorded in the ether and data has become a byproduct. There is more of it available to analyze than ever before, across a range of disciplines and worlds. It has become a source of power. Our four most valuable companies own most of the (our) data. 

Data Science offers us the tools to harness that power.  In the past, power lay in collecting data. Looking forward, power will lie with those that know how to use data well. In my industry, those that use data well have already won the race. What does using data well actually mean? Initially, it meant capturing the moderate middle. In any business (and in our lives), there are many decisions we make daily that are routine. Humans can make errors. Processes and models can make those decisions for us quickly and accurately in most instances.  Data science allows us to pick the right process.

Now we are deluged with data. It is available in varieties and volumes never seen before. Itâ€™s hard to discern truth from noise. In our analytics, data-based or not, the new goal is to find an edge, however small it might be, and build upon the small truths uncovered by others. 

My own goal is to be able to comfortably balance decision-making between intuition and data science. Data might, at times, help us understand the aggregate as never before. In other cases we can dig down into the minutiae and uncover something new. Intuition can rise above the chaos. Data-informed intuition may end up being even more powerful. I envision a world where data science is so embedded in the infrastructure of a company that good managers are able to modulate the balance between intuition and data analysis without ever having to think about it consciously. 

I also like the collaborative nature of Data Science. The tools are all open source, building upon the work of several. The assembly line that collects data, cleans it, and moves it through the system involves many companies, many people and many countries. Some players (like Google) are bigger than others. However, unlike oil or other commodities that powered the world in the past,  its hard to see anyone having the ability to bottle and control the supply and analysis of data. 

This very collaborative nature of Data Science may be the reason that spreadsheets would not exist in the future. Data would come into companies via platforms or in the cloud, with data science modules built upon each other across departments and expertise to create a whole new information structure. It could speed up learning and transfer insights across the spectrum at lightning speed. In that world, everyone would have to be a Data Scientist in some small way. 

What happens when Data Science becomes ubiquitous? Can we create herd behavior around data-based rules? If all of us use google maps on a busy highway, will we all end up clogging the local roads? Can systematic rules used by a variety of participants turn good data into a noisy signal? If geneticists can tell you exactly what a child will look like and be like before he is born, will his life have been defined before he had any control? We are a long way from having to consider these questions, for now. However, they underline another reason I find this field exciting - everything is new and unknown. As a beginner, I have a lot to learn.
